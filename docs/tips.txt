Q. What is CSRF token in Django?

Ans. Django protects against CSRF attacks by generating a CSRF token in the server,
send it to the client side, and mandating the client to send the token back in the request header.
The server will then verify if the token from client is the same as the one generated previously;
if not it will not authorise the request.
